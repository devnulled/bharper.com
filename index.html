            <h1>Hi, I'm Brandon</h1>
            <p>I'm a fourth generation Colorado native and work as a Software Engineer in the Denver metro area. I primarily write JVM based software in Scala and Java, but also like to dabble in other languages as well. In general I spend my free time teaching myself new things across a wide variety of interests, as well as taking photos around the Western US.</p>

              <p>In early 2003, I started my software blog, <a href="http://devnulled.com">devnulled</a>, as a place to blog about various issues I ran across while programming and how I solved them.  Over the years it's focus has changed a lot and I don't post nearly as often these days, but I do continue to update it from time to time.</p>
