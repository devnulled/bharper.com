          <p>
          Growing up in Southeastern Colorado as a third generation Coloradoan, I was far from the bright lights of Denver.  In a land of wheat fields and feedlots where even the closest stop light was over 70 miles away, I managed to grow-up immersed in technology.  My first computer was a Ti-99, followed by an Apple IIe, then an IBM 286. Finally during my Sophomore year of High School, I built my first computer, a 486/25.
          </p>
          <p>
          I first started teaching myself programming in BASIC at age 8 with my best friend, but also played around in a language called Synapps, and also just a bit of C++ before graduating High School.  I constantly tinkered with different things and was the town expert in Car Audio (and went on to compete professionaly after High School), built my own pinhole camera, and wrote all kinds of various software.

          <p>
          Also during High School, I was also a student athlete (all-conference Defensive End among other sports), qualified for the Colorado State Science and Engineering Fair, won a couple of programming competitions at Panhandle State University, played percussion in band, and was on our Knowledge Bowl team.  Outside of school I also did a few other things like working for farmers moving/branding cattle, moving irrigation pipe and helped my dad build and run a convenience store.

          <p>
          My humble and hardworking beginnings bring me to my current state, where I am a husband, father, and Software Engineer having worked in the field for 14 years.  Over the years I have continued my autodidactic nature and have learned about all kinds of things from different languages and techniques, to photography.  I'm currently a little over a year shy from completing my Computer Science degree, and will probably go finish it up once my kiddo is a little older.

          I'm very passionate about Software Engineering and keep up with it both for my career as well as a hobby.  I believe in Kanban, test-driven development with high levels of unit and integration tests with as much automation as possible.. to the point of continuous deployment.  I hate Perl and PHP, am at a point in my career where Java is not that fun any longer, but would work with almost any other open standards based language.  I pragmatically prefer to develop using Mac OS X, but would ditch it for Linux quite easily if they would finally agree on a desktop standard and make it suck a lot less.
          </p>
          <p>
          Personality-wise I'm pragmatic, curious, and humble. Very passionate about technology in general. Great communicator in both written and oral forms. I am not someone who likes to jump to conclusions or blurt out answers to questions I do not know the answer to. Instead, I take a more cautious approach, but am not afraid to say “I don't know, but lets try X” when we just need to make progress.  As an experienced Engineer in both startups and large companies, I have a great sense of the sweet spot between "fast" and "good" in order to support both the short and long term goals of business.

          </p>
          <p>
          In my free time over the years, I have pursued many passions both inside and outside of technology.  My biggest hobby for a number of years was racing cars and motorcycles, and doing all of my own work on them.  One of my cars, a '76 Datsun 280Z, was featured on AutoBlog's Readers Ride of the day.  I've since sold my projects and drive a respectable 5 door Subaru WRX.

          </p>
          <p>
          My current biggest hobby is Photography.  I take photos in my free time of Denver and the West, and sell them via my online store to clients small and large, and everywhere in between.

          Lastly and possibly most important out of everything you have read about me, I have maintained a sweet programmers beard for over 5 years now which helps empower me to write clean, well tested code.

          <h2>About This Site</h2>
          <p>
          I'll be the first one to admit that I'm more of a server side programmer.  That said, I created this site using other people's great work. I used Jekyll to generate all of the pages in the site, and Twitter Bootstrap for the HTML 5 based responsive layout and design.  It is hosted in the cloud by Amazon S3 and globally distributed by Amazon CloudFront.
