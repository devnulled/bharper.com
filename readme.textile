This is a quick and dirty personal home page I worked-up for myself while playing
around with Javascript and jQuery.  I put it in GitHub simply to have it in
revision control, not because I think it's awesome.

h2. TODO's
* Mavenize this stuff
* Use Coffeescript to generate the JS instead
* Maybe get rid of the link carousel?  Not sure that it's really needed
